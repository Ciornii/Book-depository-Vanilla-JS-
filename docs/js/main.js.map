In red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are known. Here, companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of existing demand. As the market space gets crowded, profits and growth are reduced. Products become commodities, leading to cutthroat or ‘bloody’ competition. Hence the term red oceans.</p><p><b>Blue oceans</b>, in contrast, denote all the industries not in existence today – the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid.In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. A blue ocean is an analogy to describe the wider, deeper potential to be found in unexplored market space.

Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?</p><p>The shocking answer is: None of the above!</p><p>In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: 'Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!' Eker does this by identifying your 'money and success blueprint.' We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.</p><p>Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and 'revise' it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.</p><p>In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen 'Wealth Files,' which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.</p><p>If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!</p>\",\r\n      \"bookLink\": \"\",\r\n      \"summaryLink\": \"\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": 25,\r\n      \"category\": \"Personal development\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Atomic Habits \",\r\n      \"author\": \"James Clear\",\r\n      \"photo\": \"assets/img/books/91pR9wKJ3zL.jpg\",\r\n      \"description\": \"<p>No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day.

The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.</p><p>Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.</p><p>Learn how to:•  make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);•  overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;•  design your environment to make success easier;•  get back on track when you fall off course;...and much more.</p><p>Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.</p>\",\r\n      \"bookLink\": \"\",\r\n      \"summaryLink\": \"\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"quotes\": [{\r\n      \"quote\": \"Remember, the moment you accept total responsibility for everything in your life is the moment you claim the power to change anything in your life.\",\r\n      \"author\": \"Hal Elrod\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"quote\": \"Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.\",\r\n      \"author\": \"Steve Jobs\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"quote\": \"It isn’t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy.
